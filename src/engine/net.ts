/**
 * net.ts — zero-backend P2P networking for browser games.
 *
 * Thin, game-friendly wrapper over Trystero (https://github.com/dmotz/trystero).
 * Trystero establishes an encrypted WebRTC mesh between everyone in a room using
 * FREE public infrastructure for the initial handshake — no server of your own,
 * which is exactly what GitHub Pages hosting needs. The default strategy here is
 * `nostr` (public Nostr relays); swap the import for `trystero/torrent` or
 * `trystero/mqtt` if relays are flaky in your region (see README).
 *
 * Netcode model this wrapper assumes: **host-authoritative star**. The host owns
 * authoritative game state and broadcasts snapshots; clients send inputs. For
 * deterministic lockstep games, pair this with rng.ts (shared seed) instead.
 *
 * The host is decided by INCUMBENCY, not by an election on every join: whoever
 * holds the room announces it, everyone else adopts, and the role only moves
 * when the host LEAVES (then min-id among the survivors, which they all compute
 * identically). A peer that has heard nothing yet is `unsettled` — isHost() is
 * false and host() is null — so nobody can act as host on a mesh that has not
 * formed. See the host section below for why both of those matter.
 *
 * Copied from the gh-game-factory patterns/ engine — do not re-roll the
 * peer/host logic here.
 *
 * Trystero limits to remember:
 *  - Action names (channels) must be <= 12 bytes. Keep them short: 'mv','snap'.
 *  - Payloads are JSON-serialized (or ArrayBuffer/Blob for binary). Keep small.
 *
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * ONE ROOM PER SESSION — THE RULE THAT MATTERS MOST
 *
 * Never leave a room and rejoin the same one to "reset" for a rematch. It looks
 * harmless and it is catastrophic. Trystero memoizes `joinRoom` on appId+roomId
 * (strategy.js: `if (occupiedRooms[appId]?.[roomId]) return occupiedRooms...`)
 * while `room.leave()` is ASYNC and defers its real teardown behind a ~99ms
 * timer (room.js). So `net.leave(); createNet(...)` in the same tick hands you
 * back the very room object that is about to be destroyed. Moments later the
 * deferred teardown clears the announce timer and unsubscribes from every relay
 * — your "fresh" Net is a corpse: permanently deaf, roster of one, and every
 * peer elects itself host. Both players sit in the right room code, alone.
 *
 * Keep the mesh alive and version the rounds inside it — see rematch.ts.
 * `createNet` enforces this: rejoining a room that is still tearing down throws.
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
