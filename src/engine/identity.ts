 * identity.ts — carry the player's display name between games, without cookies.
 * Copied from the gh-game-factory patterns/ engine.
 *
 * Every game is its own subdomain, so every game is its own ORIGIN and gets its
 * own localStorage. There is no way to read one game's storage from another. A
 * cookie on the parent domain would do it, but the games promise players "no
 * cookies" in their About panel, and a name is not worth breaking that for.
 *
 * So the name travels the only way left: as a `?n=` parameter on a link the
 * player themselves clicked (hub → game, game → hub). Each site seeds its OWN
 * localStorage from it once and strips it. No cookie, no shared store, no
 * identifier — just a name riding a first-party link.
 *
 * Be honest about the limits: this only helps when the player arrives via a link
 * that carries the name. Typing a URL, or following an invite link, still starts
 * from that game's own stored name. It is a nudge, not sync.
