/**
 * trystero-rejoin.test.ts — a CHARACTERIZATION test.
 *
 * It does not test our code. It pins down the exact Trystero behaviour that
 * caused the "we're both the host and can't see each other" bug, so that:
 *   a) the hazard is written down as executable fact, not folklore in a comment;
 *   b) a `npm update trystero` that changes this behaviour turns this red and
 *      makes someone re-read engine/net.ts before shipping.
 *
 * The bug, in one line: joinRoom is memoized on appId+roomId, but leave() is
 * async and defers its teardown behind a ~99ms timer — so leave-then-rejoin in
 * the same tick hands you back the room that is about to be destroyed.
 *
 * No network: Trystero builds the room object synchronously and only touches
 * relays through fire-and-forget promises, so stubbed WebRTC/WebSocket globals
 * that never connect are enough to exercise the whole cache + teardown path.
