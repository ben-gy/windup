/**
 * host-election.test.ts — who hosts a room, and when that is allowed to change.
 *
 * The rule, in one line: THE HOST ONLY CHANGES WHEN THE HOST LEAVES.
 *
 * Two shipped bugs live here, and both are asserted directly:
 *
 *  1. Host stolen on join. Election used to be "smallest peer id among live
 *     peers", recomputed on every join — so a peer arriving with a lower id took
 *     the room, holding none of its state. A coin flip on every single join,
 *     which is why one clean two-tab run proved nothing.
 *
 *  2. Everyone hosting a room that never formed. Each peer seeded ITSELF as host
 *     on join, so until discovery completed every peer painted itself host. On a
 *     slow or failed mesh that is permanent: both players sit in the right room
 *     code, each convinced they are the host, seeing nobody. In Windup the host
 *     also resolves every round, so a room with two hosts is a room where the
 *     two boards silently diverge.
 *
 * Trystero is stubbed: this is our election logic, and it must be provable
 * without a relay, a browser, or luck about which random id sorts lower.
