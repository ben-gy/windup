/**
 * net-lifecycle.test.ts — the tripwire.
 *
 * One invariant, asserted directly: a multiplayer session joins its room ONCE.
 * Every round after the first happens inside that room (see engine/rematch.ts).
 *
 * This is the test that would have caught the shipped bug. It needs no relay, no
 * timing model and no browser — it just refuses to let the leave/rejoin pattern
 * exist. trystero-rejoin.test.ts documents WHY that pattern is fatal (against
 * the real library); this one makes it unreachable, so Trystero is stubbed here.
 *
 * Its triviality is the point. Do not "improve" it into something clever — a
 * clever version of this test is a version that can go green while the room is
 * a corpse.
